    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p class="intro">I was born and raised in the State of Hawaii. However, I have been living in California for the last 12 years. It has been fantastic here, but I do miss home. I would love to move back, but it is incredibly expensive for everything in Hawaii.</p>

    <p>My current academic ambitions are to graduate with my Bachelor's Degree in Software Development. Although, it is not a career ambition, but more recreational. I am narrowing down on the last few semesters of my degree, and I am excited to continue learning.</p>

    <!-- This is the paragraph that will have the sentence class applied -->
    <p>There are many hobbies that I find myself getting into. <span class="sentence">I constantly find myself spending more money than I should on my hobbies.</span>  The latest hobby has been a trading card game, TCG for short. The One Piece TCG is what I have been playing and collecting, but I have considered starting with Magic: the Gathering. </p>

    <p>I also enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures. It inspires me to think creatively and expand my horizons. I have had a few trips to Japan and do plan on visiting there again soon. It has just been hard to get approved for the time off.</p>
